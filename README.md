# GenshinWishUrlExtractor

I wrote this script to simplify getting getting the url in the output_log.txt which contains the link to the wishes as an alternative to the feedback url which is currently broken.


## How to use
- View `GenshinWishUrlExtractor.ps1` as raw file and save it as .ps1 file
- Right Click the file and run it with Powershell
